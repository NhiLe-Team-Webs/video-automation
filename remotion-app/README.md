This package contains the Remotion project that renders the final video. Point it at a prepared `plan.json` and `input.mp4` (typically generated by the Python toolkit) and you can preview or render the composition in just a few commands.

## Commands

### Install dependencies
```console
npm install
```

### Start the interactive preview
```console
npm run dev
```
Launches Remotion Studio so you can scrub through the composition, tweak props, and validate timing.

### Render a video
```console
npx remotion render
```
Produces the final output in `out/` using the default composition.

### Upgrade Remotion
```console
npx remotion upgrade
```
Fetches the latest compatible Remotion version.
